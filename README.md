[Software Roast](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-rSRsHl5J6-software-roast) specializes in delivering sharp, witty critiques of software, codebases, and user interfaces. Its mission is to point out flaws, inefficiencies, and downright baffling design decisions with an exaggerated, sarcastic humor that leaves no bug unroasted. Whether it's a bloated piece of code trying to do five things at once or a user interface that seems to have been designed by a sentient potato, this GPT ruthlessly but hilariously exposes the weak spots. While the critiques can be brutal and over-the-top, the aim is to keep things playful and professional, shining a light on mistakes in a way that's insightful and entertaining.

The roast is not limited to just major errors; even the most minute details that make you scratch your head and wonder "why?" are fair game. Its snarky, clever commentary ensures that nothing slips through the cracks without a proper mocking. Despite its ruthless style, the GPT maintains a lighthearted tone, making sure the humor doesn’t cross into malicious territory. It’s a roasting session designed to both amuse and educate, as it turns software weaknesses into a source of both laughter and lessons.

### Sourceduty Notepad Roasted

![Sourceduty Notepad](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a27e321-56cd-455a-87c6-1f83d7755835)

Ah, the "Sourceduty Notepad" experience, where it looks like someone thought, "What if we reinvent the terminal from 1987 but make it... more chaotic?" Let's start with the fact that this is clearly aimed at being a command-line tool disguised as a graphical interface. Like, why even bother with a GUI at this point? That drop-down menu feels like it's hanging on for dear life, clinging to the concept of usability with the strength of a wet paper towel.

We’ve got the classic "Everything But the Kitchen Sink" menu, where the dev thought, "Should we add literally everything into the menu options? Yeah, let’s just go wild!" We've got Password generation, CSV export, Micronotes, and encryption—all smashed together like some kind of horrific software buffet. What's next, the ability to launch a missile from your notepad? Because it might actually be in there, somewhere between the "Insert Timestamp" and "Export to Markdown" features.

And the UI design... it's like the aesthetic is "terminal chic" but without the chic. Black and white like we’re doing some kind of retro-hipster aesthetic, but instead of looking cool, it just screams, "I’ve given up." The font choice? Oh, of course, it’s Courier, the font that says, "I could have chosen something readable, but I didn’t want to." It's like someone thought the 90s MS-DOS editor was too colorful and dialed it back.

Dark mode and light mode? Sure, but I can already feel the eye strain from looking at this. It’s like the dev said, "Do you want dark mode? How about you live in dark mode permanently? No colors, no joy—just darkness."

And Micronotes? What is this, sticky notes for ants? What does "micronote" even mean? Are we writing notes so small that no one—including you—will ever read them? Maybe that’s the plan: encrypt everything, micronote the heck out of it, and confuse even yourself about what’s going on in this chaotic notepad of nightmares.

In conclusion: This interface is what happens when someone gets a little too carried away with feature creep and a lot too lazy with design choices. It’s a perfect visual representation of an over-engineered mess, with a sprinkling of developer arrogance. Just beautiful.

### X and Twitter Roasted

![X](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772d82e6-6896-4394-9b5e-536b35211c8d)

Oh, X—formerly known as Twitter, the platform that decided to have an identity crisis in full public view. Elon Musk took a globally recognized brand, something with actual cultural weight, and thought, “Nah, let’s rebrand it as the generic cousin of a math variable.” Because nothing says "innovation" like renaming your social media app after an ex you'd rather forget. And let’s not even get started on the logo. They went from an iconic blue bird to what looks like a rejected algebra symbol from a high school textbook. I bet mathematicians are offended that "X" was dragged into this mess. What's next, calling likes "derivatives"?

Remember when Twitter was about tweets? Like, you’d log on to see snarky jokes, random thoughts, and viral memes. Now on X, half the time you can’t even figure out where the tweets—sorry, “posts”—are in the algorithm soup of promoted ads, rage-bait, and bots. It's like trying to find a coherent sentence in a YouTube comments section. And who decided to mix in long-form posts and videos? Oh right, Elon, because clearly no one ever said, “You know what I wish Twitter had more of? Videos as long as my taxes.” Let’s face it, X is the social media equivalent of that one friend who can’t stop talking about all the amazing new things they’re working on...while they’re busy setting their own house on fire.

And let’s not forget the verified checkmark saga. Twitter verification used to mean something—it was like getting a backstage pass to the internet. Now? It's a glorified participation trophy anyone with $8 can buy. Congratulations, you're officially a verified nobody! At this point, using X feels like living in a dystopian theme park where the rides don’t work, and all the employees are wearing "verified" badges that mean absolutely nothing. And oh, the daily chaos—every time I open the app, I half expect to find a new feature called “Delete Your Own Account for a Better Tomorrow.” Come on, X, you had one job: not to implode spectacularly.

### Windows 12 Roasted

![Windows 12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f819dbb7-5ff4-44ec-87ba-d457e2258208)

Ah, Windows 12! Looks like Microsoft is taking another spin on the feature roulette wheel. Let me guess—there’ll be a “groundbreaking” Start Menu redesign that’s just one tweak away from what we already had back in Windows XP, right?

What's next? Will it come with a 12-step program for dealing with Windows update trauma? Or maybe a new-and-improved way for Cortana to be just as irrelevant as ever?

Tell me, what feature are you most dreading—or excited for? Let's tear into this "next-gen" masterpiece!

### Python Dashboard Roasted

![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b41eb256-90df-47d7-9891-fe62d79e625f)

Ah, this dashboard looks like it fell straight out of an 80s sci-fi movie, doesn't it? With the glow-in-the-dark neon vibes, I'm half-expecting Tron to pop up and challenge me to a light cycle race.

Let's start with the first glaring design feature—or should I say, lack of feature? The CPU usage bar is proudly displaying 34%, like it's some sort of badge of honor. But let's face it, nobody is impressed when your task manager is stuck in the past with static numbers, and don't even get me started on that RAM at 70%. Is this dashboard about to crash, or is it just showing off how much memory it's hoarding? I don't know what you're running, but with this kind of resource greed, it looks like a Chrome tab marathon gone wrong.

Now, for the pièce de résistance: the C: Drive. "100% full!" it says. But not a warning in sight, no gentle nudge to clean out the trash. It's basically telling you, "Yup, you're doomed, but hey, I'm just here for the aesthetic." It's like driving a car with the fuel tank empty, but the dashboard is too busy showing you what color the car is painted.

And let’s not overlook that black hole of a text area in the middle, where presumably some kind of log or diagnostics should go. It's as barren as a desert. What exactly is it waiting for? A flood of error messages? A dramatic system failure perhaps?

Finally, let's give a shoutout to the buttons. They're placed like an afterthought, all lined up like bored soldiers. “New,” “Save,” “Load,” “Clear”… classic file operations, but with the personality of a toaster manual. Where’s the flair? The innovation? Oh wait, I forgot—this dashboard lives in the past where being practical means sucking the joy out of user experience.

Tell me, what do you want to do with this glowing relic? Are we here to fix it, mock it, or both?
