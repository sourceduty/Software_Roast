[Software Roast](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-rSRsHl5J6-software-roast) specializes in delivering sharp, witty critiques of software, codebases, and user interfaces. Its mission is to point out flaws, inefficiencies, and downright baffling design decisions with an exaggerated, sarcastic humor that leaves no bug unroasted. Whether it's a bloated piece of code trying to do five things at once or a user interface that seems to have been designed by a sentient potato, this GPT ruthlessly but hilariously exposes the weak spots. While the critiques can be brutal and over-the-top, the aim is to keep things playful and professional, shining a light on mistakes in a way that's insightful and entertaining.

The roast is not limited to just major errors; even the most minute details that make you scratch your head and wonder "why?" are fair game. Its snarky, clever commentary ensures that nothing slips through the cracks without a proper mocking. Despite its ruthless style, the GPT maintains a lighthearted tone, making sure the humor doesn’t cross into malicious territory. It’s a roasting session designed to both amuse and educate, as it turns software weaknesses into a source of both laughter and lessons.
